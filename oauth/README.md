This example includes one example, which has been converted from PHP to LSP. See the [original tutorial](https://github.com/aaronpk/sample-oauth2-client/blob/master/github.php) for details and configuration requirements.


Run the example, using the Mako Server, as follows:

```
cd oauth
mako -l::sample-oauth2-client
```

See the
[Mako Server command line video tutorial](https://youtu.be/vwQ52ZC5RRg)
for more information on how to start the Mako Server.
